<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am Xiaoda Wang, a fourth-year undergraduate student majoring in CyberSecurity at Department of Cyber Science and Engineering, Sichuan University (Chengdu, China). Currently, I am in AI-System Lab, under the supervision of [Prof. Mingjie Tang](http://merlintang.github.io/). 

In addition, I work with [Prof. Carl Yang](https://www.cs.emory.edu/~jyang71/) on Graph Neural Networks and Large Language Models.

Previously, I worked with [Prof. Haizhou Wang](http://www.cyber-wang.cn/) on Fake Information Detection. 

I am now a maintainer of [Couler](https://github.com/couler-proj/couler), an Unified Interface for Constructing and Optimizing Workflows on different workflow engines. If you're interested, please drop me an email!😁.

I have a broad interest in many topics in Artificial Intelligence, including Graph Learning, Machine Learning, Data Mining, AI Security, Large Language Model.
